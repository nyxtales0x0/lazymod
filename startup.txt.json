Ultimately, who gets (re)elected is determined based on tests of Naturalists/Harnessers (for Rey and Rav) and Savior/Tyrant (for the PC). If Naturalists/Harnessers is higher, Rey and Ravenna will need fewer points to stay in office, etc. Since this isn't for a single position, it's possible for everyone to get elected, and it's pretty likely that Rey and Ravenna will be reelected unless you specifically undermine them. Will need to track how the values end up working out to make sure that these line up appropriately, but I think this is the best way to track election viability while also incorporating the pre-existing stats.","\t*comment After chapter 7 I upped the starting values considerably (3/5/5 to 10/12/12) to give more room to maneuver without going negative, and to generally rebalance some thresholds, the viable ranges at the end of chapter 7 should be 3-15 for the PC and 6-16 for Rey and Ravenna.
